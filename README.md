## Introduction

The **Mev-Sandwich-Bot** is designed to take advantage of price differences in decentralized exchanges. By executing trades based on the Ethereum blockchain, this bot aims to maximize profits through efficient arbitrage strategies. 

## Features

- **Real-Time Trading**: Monitor the mempool for the latest transactions and act swiftly.
- **Passive Income**: Once set up, the bot can operate autonomously.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Utilize Solidity smart contracts for seamless transactions.
